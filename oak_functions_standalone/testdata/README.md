# Oak Function Standalone Testdata

Keys are specified in the form of `"(<lat>,<long>)"` where lat and long have two
points of precision after the decimal. The values are the temperatures in
Celsius of those corrdinates. Both the keys and values are UTF-8 encoded.

The data is for testing only and is not based on real temperature data.

To query the temperature, use the following keys (as bytes):

- (45.51,-122.68)
- (51.51,-0.13)
- (37.77,-122.42)
- (-33.92,18.42)
