# Contributing to Oak

Oak is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from all interested
collaborators, inside of Google and out.

## Repository Model

Oak's current source-of-truth is an internally-hosted git respository that uses
Gerrit for code review.

The internal repository is mirrored almost instantly to our public GitHub
repository.

## Contributing from GitHub

Our main development flow is through our internal Gerrit instance, and it's not
currently possible to submit changes through the GitHub interface.

However, we still welcome changes from the greater community, and are open to
reviewing pull requests from contributors outside of Google. While we can't
submit your change directly through the GitHub interface, someone from the Oak
team can work with you to make sure that your change gets submitted, with proper
attribution.

If you're interested, just open a pull request!
