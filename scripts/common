# The difference between Docker image id and image digest is that the image id corresponds to the
# hash of the contents of the image, while the image digest is a hash of the image and its metadata,
# and it is assigned by the specific registry after pushing the image there. Therefore, we should
# mostly rely on the image id locally, though we need to use the image digest when pulling the image
# from a registry first.
