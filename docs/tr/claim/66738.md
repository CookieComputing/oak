Stage 0 is a minimal firmware that is used for direct-kernel booting on 64-bit
x86 virtual machines. Stage 0 is designed to support booting kernels that are
compatible with the Linux 64-bit Boot Protocol version 2.15 as described in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arch/x86/boot.html.

This Stage 0 binary supports booting without memory encryption, or with AMD SEV,
SEV-ES and SEV-SNP enabled.

Stage 0 measures the data that it receives from the hypervisor during boot:

- Kernel Image
- Kernel Setup Data
- Kernel Command-Line
- Initial RAM File System
- Physical Memory Map (E820 table)
- ACPI Tables
