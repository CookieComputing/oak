Stage 0 is a minimal firmware that is used for direct-kernel booting on 64-bit
x86 virtual machines. It supports kernels that are compatible with the Linux
64-bit Boot Protocol. It is responsible for launching the kernel in a Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE), which can be Oak Restricted Kernel (ORK).

This claim is similar to
[Stage0](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/tr/claim/66738.md),
but for Intel TDX (Trusted Domain Execution) architecture. It serves the same
purpuse, but the implementation differs due to the differences in the hardware
and software capabilities of Intel TDX.
