# AMD SEV-SNP-Firmware-type binaries

Claim ID: 10271\

Technical claim which asserts that the endorsement subject is not the binary
itself, but an instance of `oak.attestation.v1.FirmwareAttachment`, containing
digests for various vCPU configurations. The digest of the unmodified firmware
binary is not required for the verification.

The tool
[//oak/snp_measurement](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/tree/main/snp_measurement)
can be used to produce measured digests from the unmodified firmware.
