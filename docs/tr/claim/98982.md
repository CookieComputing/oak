# Kernel-type binary

A kernel in bzImage format is split by the VMM into two parts, a kernel image
and setup data. The bzImage format is
[Linux-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmlinux#bzImage). This claim
asserts that the endorsement subject is not the bzImage itself, but an instance
of `oak.attestation.v1.KernelAttachment`, containing digests for kernel image
and setup data. The digest of the bzImage is not required for the verification
since it cannot be measured. The present claim implies the conditions of the
[inline claim](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/tr/claim/77149.md)
as the endorsement subject is needed for verification.

The tool
[//oak/oak_kernel_measurement](https://github.com/project-oak/oak/tree/main/oak_kernel_measurement)
can be used to produce the kernel image and setup data from the bzImage.
