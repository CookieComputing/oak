Technical claim which asserts that the endorsement subject is required in full
for verification. This implies that the subject size is sufficiently small. For
example, this claim is used on kernel command lines.

The endorsement subject is required in full whenever a simple bitwise equality
via digest comparison won't work. In the kernel command line example, there is a
lot of variability: there may be additional flags present which are irrelevant
for the verification and hence need to be ignored.
